## **1. CLI Basics**
**A. What's the point of the CLI?**

The CLI lets you Interact with your computer through text commands (instead of through the graphical user interface â€” a.k.a. the GUI)
	
What's it good for?
* Doing things more quickly (if you know what you're doing)
* Writing and executing running automated scripts for repetitive tasks
* SSHing into a remote server that has no graphical interface
* Accessing additional tools & capabilities not offered by GUI
	
Real software engineers & IT administrators use it in industry all the time, so for communication purposes alone it's important to understand!
***
_Before we get started:_
If you're on a Mac or Ubuntu machine, you're all set to execute Linux commands. If you're on a Windows machine, you can use PowerShell Commands (many are listed below), or you can [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) WSL on your machine to have access to all Linux Terminal commands (this is recommended! -- [click here](https://youtu.be/ZtqBQ68cfJc?si=TWcyx1v3tpyv7MUW&t=1268) for a video guide on installing)


Installing WSL on Windows:
1) Run PowerShell as Administrator
2) Execute the `wsl --install` command within PowerShell
3) Reboot your computer
4) Use the Windows key to search for the Ubuntu app and run it
5) Create a Username and password
6) (optional) [install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) and/or run Terminal and then set Ubuntu to be your default shell

***
**B. Basic commands**

| macOS   | Windows        | What it does |
|-|-|-|
| `ls`                     | `dir`                  | List files and directories in the current directory.|
| `ls [directory]`| `dir [directory]` | List files of a specific directory.|
| `cd [directory]`         | `cd [directory]`       | Change to a specific directory.                       |
| `pwd`                    | `cd`                   | Show the current working directory.                |
| `mkdir [directory]`      | `mkdir [directory]`    | Create a new directory.                             |
| `touch [file]`           | `echo. > [file]`       | Create an empty file.                               |
| `cp [source] [destination]` | `copy [source] [destination]` | Copy files or directories.               |
| `mv [source] [destination]` | `move [source] [destination]` | Move or rename files/directories.          |
| `rm [file]`    | `del [file]` | Remove files.       |
| `rm -r [directory]`    | `rmdir [directory]` | Remove directory.       |
| `clear`                  | `cls`                  | Clear the terminal screen.|
| `cat [file]`             | `type [file]`          | Display the contents of a file.                    |
| `grep [pattern] [file]`  | `findstr [pattern] [file]` | Search for a pattern in a file.            |
| `echo [text]`            | `echo [text]`          | Display text in the terminal.                      |
| `man [command]` | `[command] --help` | Shows the official manual page for a given command as well as options for the command. |

_TIP_: Use `ctrl+r` to search your command history. You can also use `history` to get a view of your last several commands, and the `up arrow` pulls up your previous command executed.

#### **Absolute** vs **Relative** paths
> _**Absolute**_ paths always begin with a '`/`' character (ex. `/Users/Barney/Desktop`). On the other hand, _**relative**_ paths are always in relation to your current directory, so if you're in the director: `/Users/Barney/Documents` and then do `cd myFriends`, you'll navigate to `/Users/Barney/Documents/myFriends`.

**D. Searching for & within files**

| Wildcard | What does it do? | Example command | Example explained|
|-|-|-|-|
| `*` | Matches any sequence of characters. | `ls *.txt`|Lists all files ending with '.txt' |
| `?` |Matches any single character.| `ls h?llo.txt`|Lists all files that match 'h_llo.txt' |patter, such as 'hello.txt' & 'hallo.txt' |
| `[abc]` |Matches any of the characters specified within the brackets.| `ls h[ae]llo.txt`| Will list list 'hello.txt' & 'hallo.txt' but not 'hullo.txt' |

Here are some commands for searching _within_ files:
| macOS   | Windows        | What it does |
|-|-|-|
| `grep ["search term"] [filename]`|`findstr ["search term"] [filename]`| Returns back the line(s) that contains the search term.|
| `sed "s/old_text/new_text/g" [filename]`|N/A - will likely use powershell for this| Substitutes old text with next text for all instances. Note that `s` stands for substitute and `g` stands for global. |

### <ins>_E. File permission basics_</ins>

In Linux, every file and directory has an associated set of permissions. These permissions determine who can read, write, and execute the file or directory. 

_Permissions are represented by three groups:_

1. **Owner Permissions**: The permissions for the user who owns the file.
2. **Group Permissions**: The permissions for users who are members of the file's group.
3. **Others Permissions**: The permissions for users who aren't the owner or part of the group.

_Each group has three permissions:_

- **Read (r)**: Ability to read the contents of the file.
- **Write (w)**: Ability to modify the file.
- **Execute (x)**: Ability to execute the file (or, in the case of directories, access them).

For instance, a file with permissions `rwxr-xr--` means:

- The owner can read, write, and execute (`rwx`).
- The group members can read and execute, but not write (`r-x`).
- Others can only read (`r--`).

### Viewing Permissions

Use the `ls` command with `-l` option:

```
ls -l /path/to/file_or_directory
```
### Changing Permissions
Use the `chmod` command. You can specify permissions in symbolic mode (using r, w, x) or in numeric mode (using octal numbers). For example, to add execute permissions for the owner:

```
chmod u+x /path/to/file
```

Or, to set specific permissions using octal numbers (where `7` is rwx, `6` is rw-, etc.):

```
chmod 755 /path/to/file
```

This gives the owner full permissions (`rwx` or `7`), and the group and others read and execute permissions (`r-x` or `5`).

***

## **2. Leveling up the CLI**

### <ins>_Piping_</ins>
We can use the pipe character -- '`|`' -- to chain together multiple commands. Often it's helpful to use the output from one command as the input of another command. Here's an example:

```
ls | wc -l
```
This sequence of commands has two parts, in sequence:
1. `ls` **&#8592;** list all files in the current directory
2. `wc -l` **&#8592;** count the number of files returned from the previous command

Chaining commands can be especially helpful for filtering & sorting large amounts of data.
***
### <ins>_Redirection & File Input_</ins>

Often we want to direct the contents of some file or process into another file or process. There are 3 basic ways in which we can achieve this:

| Character | Function |
|-|-|
|[some_output] `>` [some_file]| Overwrite the contents of some_file |
|[some_output] `>>` [some_file]| Append to some_file |
|[some_file_taking input] `<` [some_file] | Read the contents of some_file into some_file_taking_input|

### **Sending data into a file**
Suppose we have a simple Python program that reads in a name sent in and then prints back a message:

`hello.py`
```
name = input()
print(f"Hello, {name!")
```

Suppose we have another file containing a name:

`name.txt`
```
Barry Bonds
```

If we want to run the Python file and send in the contents of `name.txt`, we can do the following command in the terminal:

```
Python3 hello.py < name.txt
```
This sequence begins running `hello.py`, then hits the first line that asks for input, searches for an input stream, and find it with the `name.txt` that we directed into it, giving us the following output:
```
>>> Hello, Barry Bonds!
```

### **Writing to a file**
We can also write to a file by using the character for the other direction. --  for example:
```
echo "Dilophosaurus" > myFavoriteDinosaurs.txt
```
The above command writes to the `myFavoriteDinoaurs.txt` file, overwriting anything in it if it does exist, and creating it if it doesn't exist. If we merely want to append to it, we use `>>`:

```
echo "Allosaurus" >> myFavoriteDinosaurs.txt
```
After these two commands, my text file will look like this:

`myFavoriteDinosaurs.txt`
```
Dilophosaurus
Allosaurus
```

### <ins>_Environment Variables_</ins>


Environment variables are, in simple terms, values that are accessible anywhere we navigate in our computer, assigned to a variable. They often store useful info relevant for various tasks your machine may want to perform.

A commonly used environment variable is PATH. You can access an environment variable by typing a `$` before the variable name. For example:
```
echo $PATH
```

will print back to you the directories in which your executables exist. We can list all of our environment variable with the `printenv` command. To create an environment variable, we use:

```
export MY_VARIABLE="hello world"
```

Once we do this, we'll see this new variable in our list of environment variables.

***
## **3. Automating the CLI with Shell Scripts**

Shell scripts are a way to consolidate terminal commands into executable files that can run upon a single call. This is useful for automating tasks that might rely on CLI commands.

Shell scripts end in `.sh`, and (just like any other programming language) they have their own syntax: 

| Category             | Syntax/Command                | Description                                                                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shebang**          | `#!/bin/bash`                 | Tells the system to interpret the script using Bash. Placed at the very beginning of the script.      |
|                      | `#!/bin/sh`                   | Uses the system's default shell (`sh`).                                                               |
| **Variables**        | `VARNAME=value`               | Assigns a value to a variable.                                                                         |
|                      | `echo $VARNAME`               | Accesses the value of a variable.                                                                     |
| **Conditionals**     | `if [ ... ]; then ... fi`     | Basic `if` statement.                                                                                 |
|                      | `if [ ... ]; then ... else ... fi` | `if-else` statement.                                                        |
|                      | `if [ ... ]; then ... elif [ ... ]; then ... fi` | `if-elif-else` structure.                        |
| **Loops**            | `for i in {1..10}; do ... done` | A basic `for` loop, iterating from 1 to 10.                                                          |
|                      | `while [ ... ]; do ... done`  | `while` loop that continues as long as the condition inside `[ ... ]` is true.                        |
| **Functions**        | `function_name() { ... }`     | Defines a function.                                                                                   |
|                      | `function_name`               | Calls the function.                                                                                   |
| **Parameters**       | `$1, $2, ...`                 | Accesses positional parameters. `$1` is the first argument, `$2` the second, and so on.               |
|                      | `$#`                         | The number of arguments passed to the script.                                                         |
|                      | `$0`                         | The name of the script itself.                                                                        |
| **Command Execution**| `$(command)` or `` `command` `` | Executes a command and returns its output. Used for command substitution.                            |
| **Tests**            | `[ -f "filename" ]`           | Returns true if "filename" exists and is a regular file.                                              |
|                      | `[ -d "dirname" ]`            | Returns true if "dirname" exists and is a directory.                                                  |
|                      | `[ "$var1" = "$var2" ]`       | Compares two strings for equality.                                                                    |
| **Arithmetic**       | `$(( expression ))`           | Evaluates an arithmetic expression. E.g., `result=$(( $a + $b ))` assigns the sum of `$a` and `$b` to `result`. |

As always, reference `man bash` for further details on this topic.

[Here's](./exercises/solution/make_header_solution.sh) an example of a simple shell script that can automate the task of writing headers into our Python, Java, & C files: 

Note in this file that we use `$(some_command)` to invoke a CLI command within the script.
